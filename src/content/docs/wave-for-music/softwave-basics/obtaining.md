Below you can find the newest release of Softwave.

## macOS

Download Softwave by [clicking here.](https://github.com/genkiinstruments/releases/releases/download/softwave/Softwave_mac.zip) Then follow the steps in the installer.

## Windows

1. Download Softwave by [clicking here.](https://github.com/genkiinstruments/releases/releases/download/softwave/Softwave_win.exe)
2. When you open Softwave for the first time you might get a notification.
3. **Please select Learn more and Run anyway.**
4. Softwave will ask you to install loopMIDI, a virtual MIDI driver, if it's not already installed. If for some reason this does not happen, the driver can be found [here.](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)
   **Note that your browser may prompt a warning when trying to download loopMIDI, but we assure you that it's completely safe.**

:::caution[Old version of KORG BLE MIDI driver installed?]
Older versions of Softwave used the KORG BLE MIDI driver. It's preferable to completely remove the Korg BLE MIDI driver from the system. To do this head through Settings → Apps, search for "Korg BLE MIDI" and click "Uninstall". Verify that the driver is not present in Device Manager → Sound, video and game controllers or Device Manager → Software devices. Restart the computer.
